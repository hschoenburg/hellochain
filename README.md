# HelloChain

### A "hello world" blockchain built with the Cosmos-SDK

[Ready? Start Here](/tutorial/00-intro.md)

Hellochain is a short and simple introduction to building
application-specific blockchains with Cosmos. This repo contains both the
tutorial walkthough and a working version of the code.

The first half "Simple App" assembles a super basic blockchain and the second
half, "Custom Module" implements some custom application functionality on top
of the chain. To get the full overview of what building with the Cosmos SDK
involves, complete both sections.

### Requirements

- Golang >1.12.1 installed
- A working [\$GOPATH](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SettingGOPATH)
- Desire to create your own blockchain!

the nameservice tutorial.
